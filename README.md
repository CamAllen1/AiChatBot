# AI Chatbot Feature

This Android Studio project implements an AI chatbot feature in Kotlin, capable of detecting keywords sent by the user and replying with motivational quotes. The chatbot utilizes natural language processing techniques to analyze the user's input and generate appropriate responses.

## Requirements

- Android Studio 4.0 or higher
- Android SDK version 23 or higher
- Kotlin 1.3.70 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the project on an Android device or emulator.

## Features

### AI Chatbot

The AI chatbot is designed to engage in conversations with users and provide motivational quotes based on the keywords detected in the user's messages. The chatbot utilizes a combination of predefined responses and a keyword detection algorithm to generate appropriate replies.

### Keyword Detection

The keyword detection algorithm employed by the chatbot allows it to identify specific keywords in the user's messages. These keywords are associated with motivational topics, such as "motivation," "inspiration," "success," and others. When a keyword is detected, the chatbot generates a motivational quote related to that keyword.

### Motivational Quotes

The chatbot has a collection of motivational quotes stored in a database or a predefined list. These quotes are sourced from various inspirational figures, books, and speeches. When a keyword is detected, the chatbot randomly selects a quote associated with that keyword and sends it as a reply to the user.

## Usage

1. Launch the application on your Android device or emulator.
2. Enter a message in the chat interface to start a conversation with the chatbot.
3. Use keywords related to motivation, inspiration, success, or other similar topics to trigger motivational quotes from the chatbot.
4. The chatbot will generate a response with a motivational quote based on the keyword detected.
5. Continue the conversation by sending additional messages or keywords to receive more motivational quotes.
